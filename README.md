Knowed-Workbench
================

Desktop app to use the Knowed framework.

If you want to work on this without going crazy, check out "KnowedStuff". Maybe some day I'll learn CocoaPods.

Wanna see something neat?  Paste these lines in.
```javascript
var r = KnowedFileUtil.loadUrl('http://requirejs.org/docs/release/2.1.13/minified/require.js');
eval(r);
```
(That doesn't actually seem to work very well yet.  I'll have to figure out why soon.)
